This project predicts insurance premiums based on various customer features such as age, gender, BMI, number of dependents, smoking status, and region.
It showcases a complete end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

Features
 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing — handled missing values and outliers

 Feature Engineering — encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical ones

 Pipeline Creation — built an automated ML pipeline for reproducible training

 Model Building — trained a Random Forest Regressor to predict insurance charges

 Model Evaluation — assessed using R², MAE, and RMSE metrics

 Model Saving — serialized the final model for later inference and deployment

 tech stack
Pandas, NumPy — for data handling and preprocessing

Matplotlib, Seaborn — for visualization

Scikit-learn — for ML pipeline and Random Forest model

Joblib / Pickle — for saving the trained model

(Optional) Flask or Streamlit — for web-based prediction interface
